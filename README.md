Open source version of IBM's ISPF Dialogue Manager for Linux written in C++

Application programs wishing to use DM Services, are also written in C++.

Most services are supported, except for file tailoring, as are dynamic input/output areas and a subset of the ISPF panel language.

This as been written as a bit of fun learning C++ and OOP and I've put it on GitHub in case anyone wants to use/contribute to it.  There are a lack of applications, but there is a browser, the start of an editor similar to the PDF editor and a file list application.
