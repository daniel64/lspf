Open source Linux version of IBM's z/OS ISPF Dialogue Manager written in C++

Application programs wishing to use DM Services, are also written in C++.

Most services are supported, except for file tailoring, as are dynamic input/output areas and a subset of the ISPF panel language.  See doc directory for more details.

This as been written as a bit of fun learning C++ and OOP and I've put it on GitHub in case anyone wants to use/contribute to it.  There is a lack of applications, but there is a browser, the start of an editor similar to the mainframe PDF editor and a file list application.
