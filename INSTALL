To install:

1)  Customise lspf.h  Make sure paths ZSPROF, ZUPROF, MLIB etc exist.
2)  Compile and run setup.cpp to create the default ISPSPROF profile member, ISPCMDS and USRCMDS command tables.
3)  Compile lspf.cpp
4)  Compile applications
5)  Copy directories mlib, plib and tlib to the paths defined in MLIB, PLIB and TLIB in lspf.h if different.

Boost and ncurses required to compile lspf.cpp
OOREXX required for POREXX1.cpp but this is not necessary and really doesn't do much.
file required for PBRO01A.cpp as it is linked with -lmagic

You can use comp1 to compile lspf.cpp, compsetup to compile setup.cpp and compappls for all applications in directory Appls


Run lspf in a terminal
